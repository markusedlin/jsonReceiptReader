# jsonReceiptReader
Here is the program that runs the json reader, uploads it to a database, and then reads the database using python. 

In the repository is an example of what some of the data looks like. I don't want to upload the whole database as well as my data, as that is quite private information, telling exactly what I've bought and when.

With this program, I should be able to upload more data as well, whenever I download my shopping data at a later point. It will be interesting to see the price changes as well as my shopping patterns and how they may have changed as well.
